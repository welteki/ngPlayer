## ngPlayer

ngPLayer is a simple music player application built with Angular 2. You can discover the top 100 most popular songs of the moment. (currently only the Belgian top)

note: this app is still a work in progress. I was to impatient to finish the work to a descent level before launching the first version, so this is what you get for now :smiley:

## Overview

ngPlayer was created as an experiment to learn and explore angular 2. The app uses the Deezer API to retrieve playlists and track data (thanks [Deezer!](https://www.deezer.com)). For audio playback we rely on the [Howler.js](https://howlerjs.com/) audio library. [Angular-CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) was used to scaffold and build the project.

The app is still pretty basic right now. There is no exception handling, no mobile layout ... but i will continue building as I find some time. On top of the todo list is implementing [@ngrx/store](https://github.com/ngrx/store) for a more efficient application state management so the app can be expanded more easily.
